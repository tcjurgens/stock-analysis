Check out VBA_Challenge.xlsm to see the VBA and accurate results for this challenge working in action. 
## Project Overview
In this challenge/module we were helping our friend "Steve" analyze the performance 12 different green energy stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. We used Excel worksheets and VBA to analyze and compare Total Daily Volume and yearly Return in a code we built throughout the module.  In this challenge, we were tasked to refactor this code so that the VBA script ran faster.
## Results

Above are saved images of the pop-up messages which are shown after the refactored code (VBA_challenge.xlsm) is run. You can see that the run-times are much less than the original times (roughly .1 seconds when refactored compared to ~.5 of the original).

And for conveinence I will show the outputs of the refactored code below. The resulted outputs are expected.
